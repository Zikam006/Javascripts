# TITLE: The difference between LET, CONST and VAR in Javascript

Variables are important and fundamental components because they allow us to store and manipulate data temporaily in the computer primaries. The LET, CONST and VAR are the three variables we have in javascript. Each of these keywords have their own charcteristics and uses. But in this article, we will see the difference between the let, const and var variables.
I will explain the meaning of each of these variables before I proceed with the differences.
 
# LET: 
Simply, LET is used to create variables that can be reassigned or changed.
 # VAR:
 Var been very similar to let can also be used to create variables that can be changed.
 # CONST:
 simply, is used to create variables that cannot be changed or reassigned
    
    The differnces are as follows:
    1. var has function scope. It is scoped to the function in which it is declared, or if declared outside any function, it becomes a global variable while LET and CONST are blocked-scope
    2. LET and VAR variables can be reassigned or changed within their scope, but they cannot be redeclared within the same block while CONST variable cannot be reassigned or changed.
    3. The LET and CONST variables are not hoisted, for the LET variable they must be declared before they a
    re accessed and for the CONST they must be initialized with a value at the time of declaration.
